  **************************** Authors Notes ******************************


  This is my first attempt at doing OS/2 Full Screen, FLAT32 code.

  It was written using the editor from Borland's Turbo Pascal 6.0+7.0

  It is compiled using MicroSoft's MASM version 6.0

  It was linked using LINK386 supplied with IBM's OS/2 version 2.1

  This program requires OS/2 version 2.0 or later, and is designed
  strictly for full screen text mode.

  The source for this fine program is included. I would like to offer
  my thanks for those who helped contribute code.

  ************************* MODIFICATION HISTORY ***********************

  This document was last updated May 22,1994

Version 0.40áeta
04/22/94 - MAW On vacation, spruce things up a bit.
  Note: All of these changes are to documentation, and FORTH.INI, no real
  changes to FORTH.EXE

  Changed OPEN to abort if a file is NOT present upon open
  Added   OPENNEW to create a file, if needed.. (for output?), tested ok.

  Modified VIEW
    1. Now looks at FORTH.DOC, not FORTH2.DOC
    2. Now does not leave file open if word not found
    3. Now stops looking at bottom of list, when --End-- is found. 8-)

  Confirmed INCLUDE" only loads first time, build workaround involving
  the use of MAIN.4th

  Add HELP, and very beginnings for HELP system. (more later?)

               Create a BUILDIT.CMD file for OS/2 2.1 compilation
                 (Link386 no longer works in a DOS box!)

     EMIT KEY BYE VLIST

   Note: KEY returns the ascii code in the low byte, and the scan code

   of F1-F10, etc.


10/12/92 - Version 0.004
   Fix bugs:
      Error handling routine got contents of stack, instead of address

    : ; COMPILECALL LITERAL KEY HEX DECIMAL BASE ! @ BYE VLIST
    SWAP DUP XOR OR AND U/ U* / * - + .
